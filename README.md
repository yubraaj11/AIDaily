AI Daily is a Python application that fetches and summarizes the latest AI research papers from arXiv. Stay updated with cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence, machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision with structured summaries generated by Google's Gemini API.

## 🌟 Features

- **Automated Paper Discovery**: Fetches random AI research papers from arXiv across multiple categories (AI, ML, NLP, CV)
- **AI-Powered Summaries**: Generates structured summaries with 5 key sections using Google's Gemini API:
  1. Introduction/Core Idea
  2. Methodology
  3. Mathematical Equations
  4. Limitations
  5. Conclusion
- **Local Storage**: Stores paper information and summaries locally for offline access
- **RESTful API**: Provides a comprehensive API for accessing papers and summaries
- **Modern Web Interface**: Clean, responsive web interface built with FastAPI and vanilla JavaScript
- **Privacy Focused**: API keys are stored locally and never transmitted to external servers

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- Google Gemini API key (get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey))

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yubraj-sigdel/AIDaily.git
   cd AIDaily
   ```

2. Install dependencies using uv:
   ```bash
   uv sync --frozen
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with your Google Gemini API key:
   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### Running the Application

Start the application with:
```bash
uv run python -m AIDaily.main
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

To fetch your first paper, you can use the API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/ai-daily/v1/fetch_store
```

### Automatic Paper Fetching

The application includes a built-in scheduler that automatically fetches a new AI research paper every day at 8:00 AM server time. This ensures you always have fresh content to explore each morning without manual intervention.

You can also manually trigger paper fetching using the API endpoint mentioned above.

## 🛠️ Usage

### Web Interface

1. Visit `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser
2. Click the "⚙️ Settings" button to enter your Gemini API key
3. Click "⭐ Today's Featured Paper" to see the latest paper
4. Use "Summarize Paper" to generate a detailed summary
5. Browse "📚 Recent Papers" to see previously fetched papers

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/ai-daily/v1/health` | GET | Health check and cache status |
| `/ai-daily/v1/fetch_store` | POST | Fetch and store a new paper |
| `/ai-daily/v1/today` | GET | Get today's papers |
| `/ai-daily/v1/summarize` | POST | Summarize a paper (downloads and processes the PDF) |
| `/ai-daily/v1/paper/{paper_id}` | GET | Get a specific paper |
| `/ai-daily/v1/history` | GET | Get paper history (supports date_range query param: 7, 30, all) |

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Paper Discovery**: The application cycles through AI research categories (cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.CL, cs.CV) to fetch recent papers from arXiv
2. **Storage**: Papers are stored locally in JSON format with metadata and abstracts
3. **PDF Processing**: When requested, the application downloads the paper's PDF and extracts text
4. **AI Summarization**: Using Google's Gemini API, the extracted text is summarized in a structured format
5. **Web Interface**: The FastAPI backend serves a responsive web interface for browsing papers

## 🔧 Configuration

The application can be configured through environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DATA_DIR` | Directory for storing papers and index | `./data` |

## 🧪 Development

### Running Tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Code Quality

The project uses Ruff for linting and formatting:

```bash
# Check for issues
uv run ruff check .

# Auto-fix issues
uv run ruff check . --fix

# Format code
uv run ruff format .
```

## 🐳 Deployment with Docker

The application can be deployed using Docker for easier production deployment:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t aidaily .
   ```

2. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d --name aidaily -p 80:80 --env-file .env aidaily
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

Note: Make sure to include your `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the `.env` file when deploying with Docker.
